# Moebius Discord Bot

A small-scale, meme-based Discord bot.

# Current Features

* `It's Moebin' time`
  * Responds to each message containing the word `time` with the aforementioned phrase.
  * Currently always active. It is planned to make this a server-specific toggle.
* `/roulette`
  * A simple roulette command with several different death messages upon losing. Current odds are ~2% (Winning is intentionally incredibly rare.)

#Planned Features
* Toggle Moebin' Time
* Levelling
* Custom Profile System
* Some Competitive Features
  * Not much thought has been put into this idea. Some competitive factor is planned, though nothing specifically. May be looped in with the levelling system (Person with most EXP wins / has a better advantage)
