# Moebius Discord Bot

A small-scale, meme-based Discord bot.

# Current Features

* `It's Moebin' time`
  * Responds to each message containing the word `time` with the aforementioned phrase.
  * Currently always active. It is planned to make this a server-specific toggle.
* `/roulette`
  * A simple roulette command with several different death messages upon losing. Current odds are ~2% (Winning is intentionally incredibly rare.)
* `/moeb`
  * A community requested command, sends "IT'S MOEBIN' TIME!" in chat.
* `/hug`
  * A command to spread positivity by hugging fellow server members!
* `/pat`
  * Spread positivity by patting your fellow server members on the head!
* `/cool`
  * See how cool you are on a scale from 1 - 10! Has a pretty coloured progress bar, with a special feature if you get the fabled 10/10.
  
# Planned Features
* Toggle Moebin' Time
  * Will be possible after eceonomic features are implemented, as a database is needed to keep consistent track of which servers have this feature enabled and disabled.
* Levelling
* Custom Profile System
* Some Competitive Features
  * Not much thought has been put into this idea. Some competitive factor is planned, though nothing specifically. May be looped in with the levelling system (Person with most EXP wins / has a better advantage)
* Economy
